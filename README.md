Task Manager is a simple Android app to help users schedule, view, and manage their daily tasks.
Users can add tasks with a title, description, date, and time, and view upcoming or past tasks.
Tasks are stored securely in a local SQLite database for offline access.
The app automatically moves tasks to the "Past Events" section once their scheduled time has passed.
It features a clean, user-friendly interface with calendar integration and smooth task management.
